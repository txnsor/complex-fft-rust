Hello, this project is still WIP!

This project aims to implement...

- Generic complex numbers for all primitive numeric types. (DONE)
- Basic complex operations for i16, i32, i64, f32, and f64. (IN PROGRESS)
- FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) implementation for Vec<Complex<T>>.
- IFFT (Inverse FFT) implementation for Vec<Complex<T>>.
- DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) implementation for Vec<Complex<T>>.
- IDCT (Inverse DCT) implementation for Vec<Complex<T>>.
- Basic documentation for use as a crate.
